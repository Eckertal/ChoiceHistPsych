All code and data to reproduce analyses and figures of Choice History in Psychosis Proneness article. 

Separate .csv files are necessary for fitting the logistic choice model and psychometric functions, 
because psychometric functions require signed stimulus intensity which would falsify regression results. 
All datafiles can be produced from the raw data using the respective pre-processing scripts.
